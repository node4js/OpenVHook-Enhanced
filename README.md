[NTAuthority/citizenMP](http://tohjo.eu/citidev/citizenmp) Most of the code is from them. Ivan Meler and DKingAlpha (I only modernized it for E&E) only changed it up here and there and added their own improvements. Kudos to them though.

[FiveM](https://fivem.net/) For their hashmap and patterns. Now, sadly outdated for E&E, currently making a crossmap/native gen (runtime).

[Alexander Blade](http://www.dev-c.com/) For the ScriptHookV SDK files which can also be used with OpenVHook. *I still hate him though.*

// TODO :
Fix natives
### *(IMPORTANT) ADD DX12 HOOK*
(for later) Fix junk code
